# Parking_Slot_Detection_Using_Yolov8
An AI-based system that detects available and occupied parking spaces in video footage using YOLOv8 object detection. The project processes video frames, identifies car positions, and classifies predefined parking slot regions as free or filled, displaying the result visually with color-coded overlays.
